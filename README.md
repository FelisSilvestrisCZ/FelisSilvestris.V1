# Felis Silvestris: Wild Cat to Countryside
Felis silvestris, the wild cat, is a project aimed at reintroducing this species into the Czech countryside. The cat has been a part of the Czech landscape for centuries, and is still present today. The project has been made possible by the acquisition of more than 250 hectares of land on which it will be carried out.

In the first phase of the project, the existing population of cats in the vicinity of towns and villages will be monitored, and in more remote areas. Once the situation has been documented, the second phase will see the active promotion of cat populations in areas further away from human habitation, and the development of a methodology for the sustainable presence of wild cats. In the final phase of the project, cats will be released into the wild and their population will be actively monitored, supported and managed.

The motivation for the return of the cat to the Czech countryside is multifaceted. Firstly, there is a desire to gain a deeper understanding of their social behavior and the dynamics of their relationships, which are little-researched but nonetheless fascinating. Cats are intelligent creatures, and their interactions with each other are a combination of unique elements with surprising similarities to the dynamics of social relationships in human society. Secondly, the cat is simply a beautiful animal.

The Felis silvestris project therefore represents a unique opportunity to study an important species in its natural habitat, and to contribute to its conservation.
